            <span class="signature"><p>To whom it may concern,</p></span>
            <p>I have chosen to apply to the course Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Web Development) 1 Year (September 2022) with National College of Ireland as I believe this course to be the most direct and constructive path towards my goals. The topics covered, combined with the career bridge and work placement are the ideal solution to the biggest obstacles I am facing in the pursuit of my dream of becoming a web developer, specifically a lack of practical work experience and qualifications that could be stronger.</p>  
            
            <p>I am a graduate of TU Dublinâ€™s Certificate in Web Application Development Level 7 minor award, an intensive, fully online course offered through Springboard. As a result of this, I have adapted to blended and online learning. Through project work, hobbies and interests, I have gained a strong understanding of developing web applications across the full stack. As part of my final project submission, I was required to develop a Full Stack application. I achieved this using the front-end framework Bootstrap, Express.js and Node.js on the back-end, and MS SQL Server hosted in Azure for my Database Management System. This was an extremely rewarding experience and further strengthened my desire to transition into web development.</p>
            
            <p>My experience working with JavaScript and Python have allowed me to gain a strong understanding of the principles and usage of Object-Oriented Programming. I am tenacious in pursuit of my goals. I have worked in my spare time, continued my studies and recently earned a Certiport IT Specialist in Python certificate. I am absolutely willing to dedicate as much time and effort required to not only complete this course, but to thrive in it.</p>

            <p>Thank you for considering my career statement. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

            <p>
            Kind regards,<br><br><br>
